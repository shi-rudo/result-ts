# result-ts Skill

This skill helps you effectively use the package `@shirudo/result` also known as `result-ts` library in your TypeScript projects.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Integrate `result-ts`**: Introduce the library into an existing codebase.
- **Refactor Code**: Convert existing code (e.g., `try/catch` blocks, null checks) to use `Result` types.
- **Understand Core Concepts**: Get guidance on the library's functions and best practices.

## How to Use

1.  **Consult the References**: Depending on your needs, refer to the following guides in the `references/` directory:
    *   `api-cheatsheet.md`: A quick reference for all major `result-ts` functions.
    *   `refactoring-patterns.md`: Provides concrete examples of how to refactor your code.
    *   `best-practices.md`: Offers guidance on using the library idiomatically.

2.  **Ask for Refactoring Help**: You can ask me to refactor a specific piece of code. For example: "Refactor this function to use result-ts".

3.  **Ask for Explanations**: You can ask for explanations of specific functions. For example: "Explain how to use `flatMap` in result-ts".
